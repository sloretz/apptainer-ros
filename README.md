# Singularity ROS

This repo has definition files and tools working with [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) and [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/).

## Definition Files

If you want to use ROS in a container, the [`definition_files`](./definition_files) folder has [Singularity definition files](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.7/user-guide/definition_files.html) for using ROS in Singularity containers.

## Workspace Workflow

If you want to develop ROS or ROS based software inside a container, the [`ws_workflow`](./ws_workflow/README.md) describes a workflow for developing inside Singularity containers.
